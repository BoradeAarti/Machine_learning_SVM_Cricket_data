# SVM on Cricket Data

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classification and regression models on **cricket data** to analyze and predict player performance, match outcomes, or other cricket-related metrics.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Classification & regression using **SVM**
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares cricket data for modeling.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selects important attributes affecting predictions.
3. **Model Training**: Fits SVM classifier or regressor to the data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance with metrics like accuracy and RMSE.
